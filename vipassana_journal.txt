# A Vipassana Journal


### Day 5
[06/25/12]
[7:38am]
Where to begin? I have been at the Dhamma Vipassana Meditation Center for the last 5 and a half days. What a rich experience. I want to write all about it, and keep more of a journal. Then I want to put it all up on the internet as a blog post for others to read.
I think I would title it: "How to Gain Mastery of Your Mind".
There's so much to say I don't even know where to start. [My blue pens keep running out of ink.]
I want to say how it is kind of like a vacation for adults, were one is challenged the entire time.
Mr. Goenka, the instructor talks to us through fancy flat screen TV's every night. Well it's more of a lecture than a conversation. They call that "Discourse," and it is every night from about 7:15 - 8:30. It is typically very entertaining: both because it is interesting and at times very humorous. Mr. Goenka tells funny jokes.
The whole thing is a little odd because it is simply pre-recorded videos played off a DVD, but still Mr. Goenka seems to be a presence in the room. e sometimes seems to know exactly what I am thinking, or anticipate the most pressing questions of the day.
He will say things like "You have now completed Day 2, a very difficult day*," or "you probably worry because you can't sit still for very long, but by Day 4 you will be able to sit the entire hour without moving." This prediction came true.
He said in the discourse of Day 3 that he is 67 years old, and the videos are labeled that they were recorded in 1991, which would make him 88 today. I don't know if he is still alive; I want to ask the Assistant Teachers but I don't know if it would be appropriate. The whole experience is a little like *The Wizard of Oz*, with Mr. Goenka as the Wizard, the image of a head that speaks to us, calms our fears, and anticipate our doubts. I want to find the man behind the curtain. It must be aid that Mr. Goenka often dismisses mysticism; he makes no claims to supernatural powers, simply a lot of practice with Vipassana.
It's 7:55a now and I have to run to the first Group Session of Day 5. More later!


### Day 5

Okay Journal, I'm back. I'm going to start keeping track of the number of complete Run-Throughs of the body examination technique of Vipassana. I'm not going to count it if I don't finish, to encourage completion.
I did my first one during the 2-hour marathon Vipassana session of day 4, 3:00p-5pm. Then I had to rest in the grass, I was so tired and sore. The Course Manager asked me if I was alright while I laid there; I could barely respond that I simply exhausted. I wish I knew his name. It makes me feel uncomfortable that I interact and talk with him so much, probably next most of anyone here after the Burmese teacher, but I don't know his name. I also don't know the name of the Assistant teachers, although all 4 names (2 men, 2 women) are posted by the dining area. But they are very foreign and I can't even tell which two are masculine names, and two are the females, let alone which one belongs to the Burmese teacher and which to the Indian one.
Anyway..., I got lost while I was trying to recount how many fully Vipassana exercises I had done. I couldn't do any during the 6-7 group session last night, I was so sore and tired and distracted. But then after discourse I think I was able to do two in the thirty minutes that remained before 9am.
And then as I laid in bed last night I did a few, trying to make my body tired enough to grant sleep. even though I didn't manage to fall asleep until at least 1:30am (got in bed around 9:45pm). I didn't feel too tired today, waking up around 6:30am for breakfast. So I would guess that I probably did 4 complete run-throughs last night, although they were blunt and clumsy, not subtle and equanimous.
{10 V.E. so far}
I think that puts my total up to 10 complete Vipassana Exercises at this point.
There is so much else I want to write about, like the sayings of Mr. Goenka: "Work patiently and persistently, patiently and persistently; And you are bound to succeed, bound to succeed." and "Start with a calm and quiet mind" - that one is not always so easy, I think that is what the breathing meditation is for: to clear your mind. But I like writing.
I also want to write about the People I've met here at the Vipassana Meditation Center, such as my roommate Jack. But now the gong for lunch is ringing and I should be off. Be back soon!

[11:40am]
I am just bursting with questions. There are so many things I want to know. I want to understand the philosophy of what I am doing better.
But I am also slightly cautious. Is it bad to want to know like this? My understanding of Buddhism before I got here was that desire leads to suffering. But what is the alternative? Are we simply not to want anything? To therefore do nothing? To live like a rock? Is that happiness? This seems absurd.
After all, Mr. Goenka wanted to teach Vipassana. He wants to spread this knowledge. And he always says "May All Beings Be Happy". Is this not a desire?
And the Buddha too: he wanted to teach the path to liberation to others. Mr. Goenka says this was out of compassion, but I am not fully sure I understand. Are there some desires that are healthy? I mean, I want to be happy. One might even say that I crave it. Is this only exacerbating my suffering?
The point of this practice, the teachers say, is to retrain our mind. To regain control over our thoughts: our mental actions. When I got here, they made it clear to me that I had a wandering mind, with the Respiration meditation which practices concentration.
And now, I want to write. Every night for the last 5 days I have laid awake for hours thinking about what I wanted to write. I didn't have any materials with me, I had to go sneak out of the boundaries to retrieve this journal and pen from my car -- I'm a criminal; lock me up -- but the reason I wanted to write is because I don't trust my memory.
I want to tell the whole world about this place. About Vipassana and mastery of the mind and true happiness. Well I will probably start with my friends and family. But still, is this so bad a desire? Is it not what Gautama the Buddha also wanted? Or Mr. Goenka, and the Assistant Teachers, when they created this place?
But I want to tell as many people as possible. I want to bring happiness to as many people as possible. And I believe writing on an internet blog would be much more efficient than telling everyone in person with my mouth. It scales better. Didn't Mr. Goenka have the same thought when he recorded himself on video, so that he can give these same lectures over and over and over again to thousands of people all over the country (and world?) for the last 21 years.
I need to ask the Assistant Teachers about this. I will go meet with them now.

[12:09pm]
Okay, I spoke with the Assistant Teacher (the Burmese one). His answer surprised me, in a good way. I am glad I went and spoke with him.
He said there is a difference between a wish and a craving. And not simply because cravings are about bodily pleasure, either (as I was expecting). He said a craving is a type of attachment. It makes one's mind agitated. It is distracting and it gets you crossed. But a wish, as "May All Beings Be Happy", it is not a craving. Well it could be, in some cases, but not when Mr. Goenka says it.
The important thing for me is to not simply listen to the truth. What Mr. Goenka would call knowing it only on an intellectual level. It has to be experienced. It has to be felt. Otherwise there will only be more craving and aversion. And the only way to experience this is through the technique. Through Vipassana. I must develop my capability of mind to feel the subtle reality. Only then can I genuinely experience the Truth. The Law of Nature. Dhamma.
It might be a pure motivation, to try to spread Vipassana, but it is meaningless if I do not practice it. This is what MR. Goenka was trying to say during the discourse of Day 3. I didn't fully understand it. I must practice Vipassana, that is the only way.
My cravings, my desire to write or otherwise, it was all tied up in my ego; Distracting and agitating me. I am glad the teacher showed me my ignorance so that I can follow the right path: not to proselytize, as I craved; but to practice the technique of Vipassana and experience reality truly. Everything else will come in due time.
I will take a break now to do another Vipassana exercise run-through.

I'm not entirely sure how, but I just completed an hour-long Sitting of Strong Determination without moving my legs. I only moved my hands twice or thrice when they were very sweaty, and maybe moved my foot an inch or so. I was able to do 4 complete Vipassana exercises. Perhaps most importantly, I was able to maintain an equanimous and quiet mind throughout. Life is beautiful!
I only opened my eyes twice very briefly to check my watch after the first and second Run-Through. Then I returned to my breath and the triangle area between my lips and nostrils for the last 3 minutes when the chanting started. I could feel sensation there the entire time. This is great.
My legs are a little sore now. It will pass...
