# A Vipassana Journal


### Day 5
[06/25/12]
[7:38am]
Where to begin? I have been at the Dhamma Vipassana Meditation Center for the last 5 and a half days. What a rich experience. I want to write all about it, and keep more of a journal. Then I want to put it all up on the internet as a blog post for others to read.
I think I would title it: "How to Gain Mastery of Your Mind".
There's so much to say I don't even know where to start. [My blue pens keep running out of ink.]
I want to say how it is kind of like a vacation for adults, were one is challenged the entire time.
Mr. Goenka, the instructor talks to us through fancy flat screen TV's every night. Well it's more of a lecture than a conversation. They call that "Discourse," and it is every night from about 7:15 - 8:30. It is typically very entertaining: both because it is interesting and at times very humorous. Mr. Goenka tells funny jokes.
The whole thing is a little odd because it is simply pre-recorded videos played off a DVD, but still Mr. Goenka seems to be a presence in the room. e sometimes seems to know exactly what I am thinking, or anticipate the most pressing questions of the day.
He will say things like "You have now completed Day 2, a very difficult day*," or "you probably worry because you can't sit still for very long, but by Day 4 you will be able to sit the entire hour without moving." This prediction came true.
He said in the discourse of Day 3 that he is 67 years old, and the videos are labeled that they were recorded in 1991, which would make him 88 today. I don't know if he is still alive; I want to ask the Assistant Teachers but I don't know if it would be appropriate. The whole experience is a little like *The Wizard of Oz*, with Mr. Goenka as the Wizard, the image of a head that speaks to us, calms our fears, and anticipate our doubts. I want to find the man behind the curtain. It must be aid that Mr. Goenka often dismisses mysticism; he makes no claims to supernatural powers, simply a lot of practice with Vipassana.
It's 7:55a now and I have to run to the first Group Session of Day 5. More later!


### Day 5
[10:45a]
{3}
Okay Journal, I'm back. I'm going to start keeping track of the number of complete Run-Throughs of the body examination technique of Vipassana. I'm not going to count it if I don't finish, to encourage completion.
I did my first one during the 2-hour marathon Vipassana session of day 4, 3:00p-5pm. Then I had to rest in the grass, I was so tired and sore. The Course Manager asked me if I was alright while I laid there; I could barely respond that I simply exhausted. I wish I knew his name. It makes me feel uncomfortable that I interact and talk with him so much, probably next most of anyone here after the Burmese teacher, but I don't know his name. I also don't know the name of the Assistant teachers, although all 4 names (2 men, 2 women) are posted by the dining area. But they are very foreign and I can't even tell which two are masculine names, and two are the females, let alone which one belongs to the Burmese teacher and which to the Indian one.
Anyway..., I got lost while I was trying to recount how many fully Vipassana exercises I had done. I couldn't do any during the 6-7 group session last night, I was so sore and tired and distracted. But then after discourse I think I was able to do two in the thirty minutes that remained before 9am.
And then as I laid in bed last night I did a few, trying to make my body tired enough to grant sleep. even though I didn't manage to fall asleep until at least 1:30am (got in bed around 9:45pm). I didn't feel too tired today, waking up around 6:30am for breakfast. So I would guess that I probably did 4 complete run-throughs last night, although they were blunt and clumsy, not subtle and equanimous.
{10 V.E. so far}
I think that puts my total up to 10 complete Vipassana Exercises at this point.
There is so much else I want to write about, like the sayings of Mr. Goenka: "Work patiently and persistently, patiently and persistently; And you are bound to succeed, bound to succeed." and "Start with a calm and quiet mind" - that one is not always so easy, I think that is what the breathing meditation is for: to clear your mind. But I like writing.
I also want to write about the People I've met here at the Vipassana Meditation Center, such as my roommate Jack. But now the gong for lunch is ringing and I should be off. Be back soon!
[11:03am]

[11:40am]
I am just bursting with questions. There are so many things I want to know. I want to understand the philosophy of what I am doing better.
But I am also slightly cautious. Is it bad to want to know like this? My understanding of Buddhism before I got here was that desire leads to suffering. But what is the alternative? Are we simply not to want anything? To therefore do nothing? To live like a rock? Is that happiness? This seems absurd.
After all, Mr. Goenka wanted to teach Vipassana. He wants to spread this knowledge. And he always says "May All Beings Be Happy". Is this not a desire?
And the Buddha too: he wanted to teach the path to liberation to others. Mr. Goenka says this was out of compassion, but I am not fully sure I understand. Are there some desires that are healthy? I mean, I want to be happy. One might even say that I crave it. Is this only exacerbating my suffering?
The point of this practice, the teachers say, is to retrain our mind. To regain control over our thoughts: our mental actions. When I got here, they made it clear to me that I had a wandering mind, with the Respiration meditation which practices concentration.
And now, I want to write. Every night for the last 5 days I have laid awake for hours thinking about what I wanted to write. I didn't have any materials with me, I had to go sneak out of the boundaries to retrieve this journal and pen from my car -- I'm a criminal; lock me up -- but the reason I wanted to write is because I don't trust my memory.
I want to tell the whole world about this place. About Vipassana and mastery of the mind and true happiness. Well I will probably start with my friends and family. But still, is this so bad a desire? Is it not what Gautama the Buddha also wanted? Or Mr. Goenka, and the Assistant Teachers, when they created this place?
But I want to tell as many people as possible. I want to bring happiness to as many people as possible. And I believe writing on an internet blog would be much more efficient than telling everyone in person with my mouth. It scales better. Didn't Mr. Goenka have the same thought when he recorded himself on video, so that he can give these same lectures over and over and over again to thousands of people all over the country (and world?) for the last 21 years.
I need to ask the Assistant Teachers about this. I will go meet with them now.
[11:56am]

[12:09pm]
Okay, I spoke with the Assistant Teacher (the Burmese one). His answer surprised me, in a good way. I am glad I went and spoke with him.
He said there is a difference between a wish and a craving. And not simply because cravings are about bodily pleasure, either (as I was expecting). He said a craving is a type of attachment. It makes one's mind agitated. It is distracting and it gets you crossed. But a wish, as "May All Beings Be Happy", it is not a craving. Well it could be, in some cases, but not when Mr. Goenka says it.
The important thing for me is to not simply listen to the truth. What Mr. Goenka would call knowing it only on an intellectual level. It has to be experienced. It has to be felt. Otherwise there will only be more craving and aversion. And the only way to experience this is through the technique. Through Vipassana. I must develop my capability of mind to feel the subtle reality. Only then can I genuinely experience the Truth. The Law of Nature. Dhamma.
It might be a pure motivation, to try to spread Vipassana, but it is meaningless if I do not practice it. This is what MR. Goenka was trying to say during the discourse of Day 3. I didn't fully understand it. I must practice Vipassana, that is the only way.
My cravings, my desire to write or otherwise, it was all tied up in my ego; Distracting and agitating me. I am glad the teacher showed me my ignorance so that I can follow the right path: not to proselytize, as I craved; but to practice the technique of Vipassana and experience reality truly. Everything else will come in due time.
I will take a break now to do another Vipassana exercise run-through.
[12:22pm]

I'm not entirely sure how, but I just completed an hour-long Sitting of Strong Determination without moving my legs. I only moved my hands twice or thrice when they were very sweaty, and maybe moved my foot an inch or so. I was able to do 4 complete Vipassana exercises. Perhaps most importantly, I was able to maintain an equanimous and quiet mind throughout. Life is beautiful!
I only opened my eyes twice very briefly to check my watch after the first and second Run-Through. Then I returned to my breath and the triangle area between my lips and nostrils for the last 3 minutes when the chanting started. I could feel sensation there the entire time. This is great.
My legs are a little sore now. It will pass...
[3:40pm]

[9:06pm]
{4} {net: 23}
Well we just watched the Day 5 discourse. I don't even know what to think. I don't think that I liked it. Again, he talked about eliminating suffering by reducing aversion to pain and craving for pleasure. But sometimes I just get the feeling like they want us to be vegetables. I mean, what are you supposed to do after you leave? It seems like the only acceptable option is to spread Buddhism.
And we just sit there and are told to be equanimous, another word for resist distractions, or rather have no thoughts. And he even admitted the point of sitting there perfectly still with your eyes closed is to experience pain. To suffer and learn to endure it. If that doesn't sound like Marx' "opiate for the masses", I don't know what is.
I mean what really is the Vipassana Center's motivation for running these courses? Who's in charge? We never meet Goenka, just listen to him tell us what to believe every night for 90 minutes before bed.
And the Center says it is non-profit, (well actually it has never claimed that, but it is implied), that the workers are all volunteers. Goenka sure seemed nicely dressed. Well todo. Talked about the fancy watch a student had given him.
And why aren't we allowed to talk to each other? I mean, isn't that a little strange? Is that how we are supposed to always go through life: simply keeping our moth shut and avoiding making eye contact?
Goenka says over and over that it is "non-sectarian", not supposed to be mystical, no God up in the clouds will take pity on you and miraculously solve your problems. And that we shouldn't have blind faith. He criticized some people who have faith out of fear of Hell and greed for Heaven, but how is this any different?
I mean, we don't ever see anyone who really practices this stuff as a lifestyle. The teachers resist and discourage me from asking questions about the philosophy, only the technique, they say.
Still there is pervasive argument by authority. We are supposed to take Goenka's word, and what the Buddha taught, even when we can't experience it for ourselves (like regarding reincarnation).
I guess I just don't like all his criticism of "high-philosophy" and intellectualism. Why are these so bad? He is often spouting philosophy! Like Heraclitus' flux: can't step in the same river twice. Or the Epicurianism: life is to be happy, but simple pleasures. Or "the middle path" -- Aristotle's Golden Mean. Or suffering & immorality is the result of ignorance, as Socrates would argue. And always saying "Know Thyself!" like Plato's Academy. Or all the virtue ethics and categorical imperatives against lying, stealing, and violence. And to not value property.
I could imagine the (Marxist) bourgeois funding something like this. It keeps the workers happy, complacent, and docile as you exploit them.
And all of the Nietzschean criticism remains: "the inability to act is disguised as an unwillingness". I mean where did these morals come from? Why should we act in this way? The sickness of the weak, the slave morality, and the priestly class that's behind it all, infecting more and more with the disease of weakness. [I should reread *Genealogy of Morals*.]
I was really rolling my eyes tonight during the discussion of reincarnation. That consciousness persists and your last thought in life will shape the next. As a start, the theory completely ignores fluctuations in population size... People aren't born simply because someone else died. Birth is not the result of death.
The whole philosophy taught here is premised on this idea that Everyone Is Miserable. Life is Misery. And not even suicide will work because then the next life will only be filled with the agony of suicidal thoughts. But is everyone really suicidal? Is life really that miserable for everyone? Again, I see how this plays into the Nietzschean critique that religion is for the weak.
Buddha's solution, according to Goenka, was to "break the chain of reincarnation". To stop yourself from reacting to pain and pleasure so that there are no feelings -- Goenka called these the building materials of consciousness -- for the next life. Game Over, man. This just seems so depressing, to me. I mean he actually said that one way out would be to destroy all the objects our senses perceive -- to blow up the world, effectively -- but that this was not possible. And now thanks to nuclear science: it is possible! Is that what we should do, so that everyone is "Liberated" from the misery that is life?
Questions remain: Is everyone really that miserable? Is the purpose of life to be happy? If so, why not become heroin users (hedonism, I mean), or get lobotomies? Are Buddhists really as happy as Goenka claims? [Is there an objective way to measure happiness?]
5 days remain... I will stick it out while I'm here (even though its always free to come back), just to give it a fair trial. "Keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out." And I will try to continue to write about my experiences and reflections. 
Time to shower...
[9:42pm]

[10:14pm]
I thought, before I came here, that this place was a-religious. It certainly is not. It is very Buddhist. Tonights' discourse, #5, and #3, if I remember correctly, had a lot of dogma. There is no way to question anything. There is absolutely no discussion going on. All the religious elements are there: the promise of eternal bliss, scriptures, group chanting, ancient language, reverence for authority figure, talk of afterlife, lack of freedom to question. If there was a little less mysticism, I would recommend this place whole heartily to others. I am sure I have gotten a lot out of it, physically and mentally. But I cannot endorse some of the dogma that they espouse. 
I will continue to meditate. I still want to calm and control my mind. I still want to "know myself". But I will remain skeptical. I can't wait to talk to Paul Naamon about the experience.
[10:21pm]

### Day 6
[6/26/12]
[7:34am]
I woke up this morning very cold.
I still don't know what to think of this place. I mean they clearly have a lot going for them... it's free, they give you shelter and food, they'll lend you anything you need like blankets, flashlights, pants.
And there aren't any locked doors. I mean there are some closets that are locked and things in the back but they don't try to lock you in here at all. I am glad I didn't give my car keys on the first day when they collected valuables.
Last night I worried that someone might come into my room while I was in the Meditation Hall and search through my stuff. That they might find this journal and confiscate it. I think that would go against their precept "don't take what isn't given" (ie. don't steal), but what could I do to defend myself? Calling them out on hypocrisy would solve nothing, and only engender animosity towards me.
I don't know what to do. I don't want to be vulnerable. I don't even know in what ways I am vulnerable. I doubt they would try to hold me here against my will. But if they did, I imagined myself making threats. That my parents are both lawyers: my mom a US Attorney for the Dept. of Justice, and my dad the second-in-charge for the City of Dallas (8th largest city in the U.S.? I'm not sure). And that Congressman John Olver, the Federal Representative for this region, had given me his Congressional nomination to the Academy at West Point. How would they like it if the United States Army came looking for me? What would the response be if the government heard foreign nationals were holding me here against my will?
But all of these were simply pre-emptive imaginary fears. I don't have much reason to actually believe that they would do these things. They are pacifists, after all (or so they claim).
I think I feel threatened by this "Noble Silence." Goenka says the 4 Noble Truths are called that because "one who understands and follows them becomes Noble"; I think the implication here is the same. They present silence as a matter of morality, but what about the Freedom of the First Amendment? This is exactly what it is supposed to protect. 
And I also feel uncomfortable that we can not ask questions about the philosophy and dogma (even though Goenka tries to hide the fact that this is what his discourses are). He tells us that one cannot become Liberated by simply hearing the truth, or on the authority of others. Instead, one *must* experience it for themselves. But how am I supposed to experience what he says about reincarnation, the path to happiness, etc? I suppose I should continue to practice the meditation with an open mind, but I wish they didn't spend so much time espousing their religious dogma; trying to force certain beliefs on me.
And I don't understand how he can say "high-philosophy" is unimportant, that we should only ask questions about the meditative technique, when he spends 90 minutes every night telling us what to believe. I mean clearly there is an inconsistency there, no? Is this not hypocritical?
It's time for the first Sitting of Strong Determination of the day, so I must go now. More later...
I still want to recount my experiences of the first 4 days, like how I found a 4-leaf clover, what it was like when we first got here, my troubles at first with calming my mind and siting still, etc...
[7:56am]

[9:39am]

I am supposed to be meditating right now, but I'd really rather write. One might say I even crave doing so. Mr. Goenka often says the Law of Nature is Impermanence. Every sensation, pain and pleasure, comes and goes. Everything dies. Nothing will last forever. This is the reality, one part of the Ultimate Truth, that we are supposed to experience ourselves by practicing Vipassana. Only then can we free ourselves from the attachment and clinging and aversion and fear for pain and pleasure, for getting what we want and avoiding what we don't want.
Similarly, I believe thoughts come and go. That they are quite impermanent. It is for that reason that I feel a *need* to write. I fear forgetting this experience, I am attached to it and I wish to hold on, to cling to it for as long as possible. This is what I hope to achieve by writing, by keeping this journal. I suspect if I shared these feelings with the Assistant Teachers, they would tell me that I am only reinforcing my fears and attachment. And yet I persist.
This morning's Group Meditation -- Sitting of Strong Determination, I mean (what a "Noble" name for sitting perfectly still with one's eyes closed for an hour) -- went better than I was expecting. Although I was feeling so anxious and fearful and perhaps threatened before it began, I was able to calm my mind somewhat and get in touch with the sensations all over my body. I did 5 complete rounds through my body in about 50 minutes, and then used the remaining time to practice my concentration with the Anapana Respiration Meditation. And I did not move my legs for the entire hour, nor open my eyes except once after I had finished the fourth round to quickly check my watch to see if I could squeeze in another round.
And surprisingly, and pleasantly, the hour long session seemed to really calm my fears from this morning, Or it made me docile; what's the difference? Either way, it was empirical evidence for me that practicing this meditation can calm me down and quiet the mind.
Now I would like to recount my memories of the first 4 days, while they still last.
